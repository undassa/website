<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Privacy Statement</h1>
<br />
<p>
<small>This Privacy Statement is effective September 1, 2014.</small>
<small>Last.Backend, llc. ("Last.Backend" or the "Company") is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit the Company's Web sites ("Visitors") and individuals who register to use the Services as defined below ("Customers"). This Privacy Statement describes Last.Backend's Web site privacy practices in relation to the use of the Company's Web sites and the related applications and services offered by Last.Backend (the "Services").</small>
</p>

<br />
<h5>1. Web sites covered</h5>
<p>
  <small>
This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of Web sites that link to this Privacy Statement, including  <strong> www.lastbackend.com </strong> and other Last.Backend Web sites linked from <strong> www.lastbackend.com/policy </strong> (referred to as "Last.Backend's Web sites". Some Web sites hosted on the Last.Backend.com domain may be created and managed by Last.Backend's customers, rather than Last.Backend. Those Web sites do not link to this Privacy Statement, and are instead governed by the privacy statement of the Last.Backend customer that creates and manages the Web site.

Last.Backend enables its customers to create Web sites and applications that run natively on the Last.Backend platform. When Last.Backend Web sites are posted by Last.Backend, the site will link to this Privacy Statement, and this Privacy Statement applies. When Last.Backend Web sites are posted by third parties, the privacy statement of the third party applies, and this Privacy Statement does not apply.

Last.Backend also enables its customers to use third-party services (referred to as "integrations") as part of running Web applications on the Company's platform. When you share information with these third-party integration services, the privacy statement of the third party applies. Last.Backend's Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. The information practices or content of such other Web sites is governed by the privacy statements of such other Web sites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.
  </small>
</p>

<br />
<h5> 2. Information collected </h5>

<p>
  <small>
When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, Last.Backend may require you to provide the Company with personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address ("Required Contact Information"). When purchasing the Services, Last.Backend requires you to provide the Company with financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name, billing address, and credit card number ("Billing Information"). Last.Backend may also ask you to provide additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry ("Optional Information"). Required Contact Information, Billing Information, and Optional Information about Customers are referred to collectively as "Data About Last.Backend Customers."

As you navigate the Company's Web site, Last.Backend may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons ("Web Site Navigational Information"). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and the actions you take on the Company's Web sites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). For additional information about the collection of Web Site Navigational Information by Last.Backend and others, please click here.
  </small>
</p>

<br />
<h5> 3. Use of information collected </h5>
<p>
  <small>
The Company uses Data About Last.Backend Customers to perform the services requested. For example, if you fill out a "Support" Web form, the Company will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services. Also, Customers may elect to invite a friend to use Last.Backend's Services in a collaborative manner (referred to as adding "collaborators"). Last.Backend must receive the email address of the friend, and sends the friend an invitation email.

The Company may also use Data About Last.Backend Customers for marketing purposes. For example, the Company may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding the Company and its partners, such as information about promotions or events.

Last.Backend uses credit card information solely to check the financial qualifications of prospective Customers and to collect payment for the Services.

Last.Backend uses Web Site Navigational Information to operate and improve the Company's Web site. The Company may also use Web Site Navigational Information alone or in combination with Data About Last.Backend Customers to provide personalized information about the Company. For additional information about the use of Web Site Navigational Information, please click here.
</small>
</p>

<br />
<h5> 4. Web Site Navigational Information </h5>

<p>
  <small>
Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses

Last.Backend uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company's Web sites ("Web Site Navigational Information"). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information that may be collected on the Company's Web sites and how this information may be used.

Cookies - Last.Backend uses cookies to make interactions with the Company's Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit the Company's Web site, Last.Backend's servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Last.Backend, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a "Support"), you remain anonymous to the Company.

Last.Backend uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable your Web browser's ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company's Web sites, but the functionality and features of the Services may be affected, and you may not be able to successfully use the Services. Similarly, if you disable JavaScript, some features of the Company's Web sites may not function properly, and some areas of the Company's Web sites may not function at all.

If you have chosen to identify yourself to Last.Backend, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services.

Last.Backend uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company's Web site. When you purchase the Services or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser's ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company's Web site, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.

Last.Backend may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Last.Backend Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.

Web Beacons - Last.Backend uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors' usage of the Company's Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, Last.Backend may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to the Company's Web site. Last.Backend uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company's Web sites and email communications.

Last.Backend may use information from Web beacons in combination with Data About Last.Backend Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.

IP Addresses - When you visit Last.Backend's Web site, the Company collects your Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Last.Backend uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company's Web site.

Do Not Track - Currently, various browsers "“ including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari "“ offer a "do not track" or "DNT" option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Last.Backend does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Last.Backend takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
</small>
</p>

<br />
<h5> 5. Public forums and customer testimonials </h5>
<p> <small>

Last.Backend may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company's Web site. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Last.Backend is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.

Last.Backend may post a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company's Web sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Last.Backend obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.
</small>
</p>

<br />
<h5> 6. Sharing of Information Collected </h5>
<p>
<br/>Service Providers <br /> 
<small>
Last.Backend may share Data About Last.Backend Customers with the Company's contracted service providers so that these service providers can provide services on our behalf. Without limiting the foregoing, Last.Backend may also share Data About Last.Backend Customers with the Company's service providers to ensure the quality of information provided, and with third-party social networking and media Web sites, such as Facebook, for marketing and advertising on those Web sites. Unless described in this Privacy Statement, Last.Backend does not share, sell, rent, or trade any information provided with third parties for their promotional purposes.
</small>
<br /> <br />Last.Backend Affiliates <br />
<small>
The Company may share Data About Last.Backend Customers with other companies in order to work with them, including affiliates of the salesforce.com corporate group. For example, the Company may need to share Data About Last.Backend Customers for customer relationship management purposes.
</small>
<br /><br />Business Partners <br />
<small>
From time to time, Last.Backend may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services. If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from Last.Backend, the Company may share Data About Last.Backend Customers collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s). Last.Backend does not control our business partners' use of the Data About Last.Backend Customers we collect, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.
</small>
<br /><br />Billing <br />
<small>
Last.Backend uses a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on the Company's behalf.
</small>
<br /><br />Compelled Disclosure <br /> 
<small>
Last.Backend reserves the right to use or disclose information provided if required by law or if the Company reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect the Company's rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
</small>
</p> 

<br />
<h5> 7. International transfer of information collected </h5>

<p>
  <small>
